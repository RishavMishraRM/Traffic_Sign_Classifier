# **Traffic Sign Recognition** 


### **Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**
The goals/steps of this project are the following:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelrast/lenet-traffic-sign-classifier/master/README.md"></a>
  
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy, and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.
I used the NumPy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set
